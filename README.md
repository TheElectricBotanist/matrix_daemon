# display_stats (previously matrix_daemon)
Contains a simple background program to display CPU/RAM usage via the Framework LED Matrix displays.

You will need to install the input-module control program to $PATH for this software to work correctly.  It
can be downloaded from the Framework GitHub at: https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/inputmodule-rs/tree/main

I have not tested this software under all circumstances but it appears to work well when autostarted at login.
